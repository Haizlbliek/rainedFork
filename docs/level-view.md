# Overview
## Level viewport
![The Level viewport](img/level-view.png)

The level viewport is the window that takes up the majority of the screen. It is where you can see and interact with the level that is currently being edited.

You can zoom in and out by using the scroll wheel, the options in the View menu, or the <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> keys. Panning the level is done by either moving the mouse while holding down the middle mouse button or <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, or by using the arrow keys. If you are using the arrow keys, holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> will speed up the panning.

## Edit modes
Each level has several aspects that can be edited in separate "edit modes", also called "editors" by most people.

Listed are all seven edit modes:

- **[Environment](editors/env.md)**: Edit miscellaneous properties about the level.
- **[Geometry](editors/geo.md)**: Edit the playable geometry and objects in the level.
- **[Tiles](editors/tiles.md)**: Make your levels look like something.
- **[Cameras](editors/cameras.md)**: Place static cameras.
- **[Light](editors/light.md)**: Edit lights and shadows.
- **[Effects](editors/effects.md)**: Procedurally generated decorations, erosion, and effects.
- **[Props](editors/props.md)**: Place decorative objects in the level with full freedom of positioning, rotation, and scaling.

The current edit mode can be changed by either pressing number keys 1-7, selecting an option from the "Edit Mode" listbox located near the top-left of the screen, or by opening the radial menu using the <kbd>`</kbd> button.
